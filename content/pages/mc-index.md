**Private Servers:**
--------------------

Some players have specifically paid to host special servers here as well. Currently there are two other public servers:

* "adv.admalledd.com" (if SRV records work for you, if not "mc.admalledd.com:25566") server that plays custom adventure/game maps from time to time. At the time of this update it is a whitelist only CTM map, email admalledd+mc@gmail.com if you wish to play.

* "mod.admalledd.com" (if SRV records work for you, if not "mc.admalledd.com:25568") server that is a "vanilla" dnstech 1.6.4 server, check out the [forum](/php/forum/viewforum.php?f=3) for more information.
