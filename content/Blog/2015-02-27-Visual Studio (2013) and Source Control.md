Summary: VS surprisingly does not really have a concept of branching. Or files... Here are some concepts to keep in mind when using TFS or git with VS



So let us start out: I admit to being rather new to Visual Studio, this is just a collection of things that I have noticed and learned. For the most part once you (and the rest of your dev team) get up to speed and your head wrapped around VS/TFS (or git+VS) then most of this will become a non-issue. Until then you might have the same "fun" I was having with missing files, bad builds, and general hair-pulling with the Team Explorer.

Here I am going to document a few of the things I noticed about how TFS/Visual studio <sup>(2013 pro)</sup> handles things
